10  and i saw another strong angel descending from heaven arrayed with a cloud and a rainbow was on his head and his face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire
2  and he had in his hand a little scroll that had been unrolled
and he set his right foot on the sea but his left one on the earth
3  and he cried out with a loud voice just as when a lion roars
and when he cried out the voices of the seven thunders spoke
4  now when the seven thunders spoke i was about to write but i heard a voice out of heaven say seal up the things the seven thunders spoke and do not write them down
5  the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven
6  and he swore by the one who lives forever and ever who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it there will be no delay any longer
7  but in the days when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet the sacred secret that god declared as good news to his own slaves the prophets is indeed brought to a finish
8  and i heard the voice out of heaven speaking again with me and saying go take the opened scroll that is in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth
9  i went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll
he said to me take it and eat it up and it will make your stomach bitter but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey
10  i took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel and ate it and in my mouth it was sweet like honey but when i had eaten it my stomach was made bitter
11  and they said to me you must prophesy again about peoples and nations and tongues and many kings
4  after this i saw and look an opened door in heaven and the first voice that i heard speaking with me was like a trumpet saying come up here and i will show you the things that must take place
2  after this i immediately came to be in the power of the spirit and look a throne was in its position in heaven and someone was seated on the throne
3  and the one seated had the appearance of a jasper stone and a sardius stone and all around the throne was a rainbow like an emerald in appearance
4  all around the throne were 24 thrones and on these thrones i saw seated 24 elders dressed in white garments and on their heads golden crowns
5  from the throne were coming lightning and voices and thunders and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne and these mean the seven spirits of god
6  before the throne was something resembling a glassy sea like crystal
in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures that were full of eyes in front and behind
7  the first living creature was like a lion and the second living creature was like a young bull and the third living creature had a face like a mans and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle
8  as for the four living creatures each one of them had six wings they were full of eyes all around and underneath
and continuously day and night they say holy holy holy is jehovah god the almighty who was and who is and who is coming
9  whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to the one seated on the throne the one who lives forever and ever
10  the 24 elders fall down before the one seated on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever and they cast their crowns before the throne saying
11  you are worthy jehovah our god to receive the glory and the honor and the power because you created all things and because of your will they came into existence and were created
11  and a reed like a rod was given to me as he said get up and measure the temple sanctuary of god and the altar and those worshipping in it
2  but as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary leave it out and do not measure it because it has been given to the nations and they will trample the holy city underfoot for 42 months
3  i will cause my two witnesses to prophesy for 1260 days dressed in sackcloth
4  these are symbolized by the two olive trees and the two lampstands and are standing before the lord of the earth
5  if anyone wants to harm them fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies
if anyone should want to harm them this is how he must be killed
6  these have the authority to shut up the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every sort of plague as often as they wish
7  when they have finished their witnessing the wild beast that ascends out of the abyss will wage war with them and conquer them and kill them
8  and their corpses will be on the main street of the great city that is in a spiritual sense called sodʹom and egypt where their lord was also executed on the stake
9  and those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days and they do not allow their corpses to be laid in a tomb
10  and those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and celebrate and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those dwelling on the earth
11  after the three and a half days spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood on their feet and great fear fell upon those who saw them
12  and they heard a loud voice from heaven say to them come up here
and they went up into heaven in the cloud and their enemies saw them
13  in that hour there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell and 7000 persons were killed by the earthquake and the rest became frightened and gave glory to the god of heaven
14  the second woe is past
look the third woe is coming quickly
15  the seventh angel blew his trumpet
and there were loud voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he will rule as king forever and ever
16  and the 24 elders who were seated before god on their thrones fell upon their faces and worshipped god
17  saying we thank you jehovah god the almighty the one who is and who was because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king
18  but the nations became wrathful and your own wrath came and the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward your slaves the prophets and the holy ones and those fearing your name the small and the great and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth
19  and the temple sanctuary of god in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple sanctuary
and there were flashes of lightning and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hail
8  when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour
2  and i saw the seven angels who stand before god and seven trumpets were given to them
3  another angel holding a golden incense vessel arrived and stood at the altar and a large quantity of incense was given him to offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones on the golden altar that was before the throne
4  the smoke of the incense from the hand of the angel ascended with the prayers of the holy ones before god
5  but right away the angel took the incense vessel and he filled it with some of the fire of the altar and hurled it to the earth
and there were thunders and voices and flashes of lightning and an earthquake
6  and the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them
7  the first one blew his trumpet
and there was hail and fire mingled with blood and it was hurled to the earth and a third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all the green vegetation was burned up
8  the second angel blew his trumpet
and something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea
and a third of the sea became blood
9  and a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were wrecked
10  the third angel blew his trumpet
and a great star burning like a lamp fell from heaven and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters
11  the name of the star is wormwood
and a third of the waters turned into wormwood and many of the people died from the waters because these had been made bitter
12  the fourth angel blew his trumpet
and a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars in order that a third of them might be darkened and the day might not have light for a third of it and the night likewise
13  and i saw and i heard an eagle flying in midheaven say with a loud voice woe woe woe to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets
16  and i heard a loud voice out of the sanctuary say to the seven angels go and pour out the seven bowls of the anger of god on the earth
2  the first one went off and poured out his bowl on the earth
and a hurtful and malignant ulcer afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast and who were worshipping its image
3  the second one poured out his bowl into the sea
and it became blood like that of a dead man and every living creature died yes the things in the sea
4  the third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water
and they became blood
5  i heard the angel over the waters say you the one who is and who was the loyal one are righteous for you have issued these judgments
6  because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets and you have given them blood to drink they deserve it
7  and i heard the altar say yes jehovah god the almighty true and righteous are your judgments
8  the fourth one poured out his bowl on the sun and to the sun it was granted to scorch the people with fire
9  and the people were scorched by the great heat but they blasphemed the name of god who has the authority over these plagues and they did not repent and give glory to him
10  the fifth one poured out his bowl on the throne of the wild beast
and its kingdom became darkened and they began to gnaw their tongues because of their pain
11  but they blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers and they did not repent of their works
12  the sixth one poured out his bowl on the great river euphraʹtes and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the rising of the sun
13  and i saw three unclean inspired expressions that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet
14  they are in fact expressions inspired by demons and they perform signs and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth to gather them together to the war of the great day of god the almighty
15  look i am coming as a thief
happy is the one who stays awake and keeps his outer garments so that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness
16  and they gathered them together to the place that is called in hebrew armageddon
17  the seventh one poured out his bowl on the air
at this a loud voice came out of the sanctuary from the throne saying it has come to pass
18  and there were flashes of lightning and voices and thunders and there was a great earthquake unlike any that had occurred since men came to be on the earth so extensive and so great was the earthquake
19  the great city split into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and babylon the great was remembered before god to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath
20  also every island fled and mountains were not found
21  then great hailstones each about the weight of a talent fell from heaven on the people and the people blasphemed god because of the plague of hail for the plague was unusually great
18  after this i saw another angel descending from heaven with great authority and the earth was illuminated by his glory
2  and he cried out with a strong voice saying she has fallen babylon the great has fallen and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a place where every unclean spirit and every unclean and hated bird lurks
3  for because of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality all the nations have fallen victim and the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her and the merchants of the earth became rich owing to the power of her shameless luxury
4  and i heard another voice out of heaven say get out of her my people if you do not want to share with her in her sins and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues
5  for her sins have massed together clear up to heaven and god has called her acts of injustice to mind
6  repay her in the way she treated others yes pay her back double for the things she has done in the cup she has mixed mix a double portion for her
7  to the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury to that extent give her torment and mourning
for she keeps saying in her heart i sit as queen and i am not a widow and i will never see mourning
8  that is why in one day her plagues will come death and mourning and famine and she will be completely burned with fire because jehovah god who judged her is strong
9  and the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality with her and lived with her in shameless luxury will weep and beat themselves in grief over her when they see the smoke from her burning
10  they will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and say too bad too bad you great city babylon you strong city because in one hour your judgment has arrived
11  also the merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her because there is no one to buy their full cargo anymore
12  a full cargo of gold silver precious stones pearls fine linen purple cloth silk and scarlet cloth and everything made from scented wood and every sort of object made from ivory and from precious wood copper iron and marble
13  also cinnamon indian spice incense perfumed oil frankincense wine olive oil fine flour wheat cattle sheep horses carriages slaves and human lives
14  yes the fine fruit that you desired has left you and all the delicacies and the splendid things have vanished from you never to be found again
15  the merchants who sold these things who became rich from her will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and will weep and mourn
16  saying too bad too bad the great city clothed with fine linen purple and scarlet and richly adorned with gold ornaments precious stones and pearls
17  because in one hour such great riches have been devastated and every ship captain and every seafaring person and sailors and all those who make a living by the sea stood at a distance
18  and cried out as they looked at the smoke from her burning and said what city is like the great city
19  they threw dust on their heads and cried out weeping and mourning and said too bad too bad the great city in which all those who had ships at sea became rich from her wealth because in one hour she has been devastated
20  be glad over her o heaven also you holy ones and apostles and prophets because god has pronounced his judgment on her in your behalf
21  and a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea saying thus with a swift pitch will babylon the great city be hurled down and she will never be found again
22  and the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the harp of musicians of flutists and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again
and no craftsman who practices any trade will ever be found in you again and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you again
23  no light of a lamp will ever shine in you again and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will ever be heard in you again for your merchants were the topranking men of the earth and by your spiritistic practices all the nations were misled
24  yes in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth
17  one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me come i will show you the judgment on the great prostitute who sits on many waters
2  with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and earths inhabitants were made drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality
3  and he carried me away in the power of the spirit into a wilderness
and i saw a woman sitting on a scarletcolored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns
4  the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and she was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls and she had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her sexual immorality
5  on her forehead was written a name a mystery babylon the great the mother of the prostitutes and of the disgusting things of the earth
6  and i saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of jesus
well on seeing her i was greatly amazed
7  so the angel said to me why is it that you were amazed i will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the wild beast that is carrying her and that has the seven heads and the ten horns
8  the wild beast that you saw was but is not and yet is about to ascend out of the abyss and it is to go off into destruction
and the inhabitants of the earththose whose names have not been written in the scroll of life from the founding of the worldwill be amazed when they see how the wild beast was but is not and yet will be present
9  this calls for a mind that has wisdom the seven heads mean seven mountains where the woman sits on top
10  and there are seven kings five have fallen one is and the other has not yet arrived but when he does arrive he must remain a short while
11  and the wild beast that was but is not it is also an eighth king but it springs from the seven and it goes off into destruction
12  the ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but they do receive authority as kings for one hour with the wild beast
13  these have one thought so they give their power and authority to the wild beast
14  these will battle with the lamb but because he is lord of lords and king of kings the lamb will conquer them
also those with him who are called and chosen and faithful will do so
15  he said to me the waters that you saw where the prostitute is sitting mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues
16  and the ten horns that you saw and the wild beast these will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire
17  for god put it into their hearts to carry out his thought yes to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast until the words of god will have been accomplished
18  and the woman whom you saw means the great city that has a kingdom over the kings of the earth
9  the fifth angel blew his trumpet
and i saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth and the key to the shaft of the abyss was given to him
2  he opened the shaft of the abyss and smoke ascended out of the shaft like the smoke of a great furnace and the sun was darkened also the air by the smoke of the shaft
3  and locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth and authority was given to them the same authority that the scorpions of the earth have
4  they were told not to harm the vegetation of the earth or any green plant or any tree but only those people who do not have the seal of god on their foreheads
5  and it was granted the locusts not to kill them but to torment them five months and their torment was like torment by a scorpion when it strikes a person
6  in those days people will seek death but will by no means find it and they will long to die but death will flee from them
7  and in appearance the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle on their heads were what seemed to be crowns of gold and their faces were like human faces
8  but they had hair like womens hair
and their teeth were like those of lions
9  and they had breastplates like iron breastplates
and the sound of their wings was like the sound of horsedrawn chariots rushing into battle
10  also they have tails with stingers like scorpions and in their tails is their authority to hurt the people for five months
11  they have over them a king the angel of the abyss
in hebrew his name is abadʹdon but in greek he has the name apolʹlyon
12  the one woe is past
look two more woes are coming after these things
13  the sixth angel blew his trumpet
and i heard one voice from the horns of the golden altar that is before god
14  say to the sixth angel who had the trumpet untie the four angels who are bound at the great river euphraʹtes
15  and the four angels who have been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were untied to kill a third of the people
16  the number of the armies of cavalry was two myriads of myriads i heard the number of them
17  and this is how i saw the horses in the vision and those seated on them they had firered and hyacinthblue and sulfuryellow breastplates and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths
18  a third of the people were killed by these three plagues by the fire and the smoke and the sulfur that came out of their mouths
19  for the authority of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails for their tails are like serpents and have heads and with these they inflict harm
20  but the rest of the people who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands they did not stop worshipping the demons and the idols of gold and silver and copper and stone and wood which can neither see nor hear nor walk
21  and they did not repent of their murders nor of their spiritistic practices nor of their sexual immorality nor of their thefts
7  after this i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding tight the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree
2  and i saw another angel ascending from the sunrise having a seal of the living god and he called with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea
3  saying do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until after we have sealed the slaves of our god in their foreheads
4  and i heard the number of those who were sealed 144000 sealed out of every tribe of the sons of israel
5  out of the tribe of judah 12000 sealedout of the tribe of reuʹben 12000out of the tribe of gad 12000
6  out of the tribe of ashʹer 12000out of the tribe of naphʹtali 12000out of the tribe of manasʹseh 12000
7  out of the tribe of simʹeon 12000out of the tribe of leʹvi 12000out of the tribe of isʹsachar 12000
8  out of the tribe of zebʹulun 12000out of the tribe of joseph 12000out of the tribe of benjamin 12000 sealed
9  after this i saw and look a great crowd which no man was able to number out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues standing before the throne and before the lamb dressed in white robes and there were palm branches in their hands
10  and they keep shouting with a loud voice saying salvation we owe to our god who is seated on the throne and to the lamb
11  all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures and they fell facedown before the throne and worshipped god
12  saying amen let the praise and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our god forever and ever
amen
13  in response one of the elders said to me these who are dressed in the white robes who are they and where did they come from
14  so right away i said to him my lord you are the one who knows
and he said to me these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb
15  that is why they are before the throne of god and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple and the one seated on the throne will spread his tent over them
16  they will hunger no more nor thirst anymore neither will the sun beat down on them nor any scorching heat
17  because the lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and will guide them to springs of waters of life
and god will wipe out every tear from their eyes
22  and he showed me a river of water of life clear as crystal flowing out from the throne of god and of the lamb
2  down the middle of its main street
on both sides of the river were trees of life producing 12 crops of fruit yielding their fruit each month
and the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations
3  and there will no longer be any curse
but the throne of god and of the lamb will be in the city and his slaves will offer him sacred service
4  and they will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads
5  also night will be no more and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight for jehovah god will shed light upon them and they will rule as kings forever and ever
6  he said to me these words are faithful and true yes jehovah the god who inspired the prophets has sent his angel to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place
7  look i am coming quickly
happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll
8  well i john was the one hearing and seeing these things
when i heard and saw them i fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things
9  but he tells me be careful do not do that i am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers the prophets and of those observing the words of this scroll
worship god
10  he also tells me do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll for the appointed time is near
11  let the one who is unrighteous continue in unrighteousness and let the filthy one continue in his filth but let the righteous one continue in righteousness and let the holy one continue in holiness
12  look i am coming quickly and the reward i give is with me to repay each one according to his work
13  i am the alʹpha and the omeʹga the first and the last the beginning and the end
14  happy are those who wash their robes so that they may have authority to go to the trees of life and that they may gain entrance into the city through its gates
15  outside are the dogs and those who practice spiritism and those who are sexually immoral and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices lying
16  i jesus sent my angel to bear witness to you about these things for the congregations
i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright morning star
17  and the spirit and the bride keep on saying come and let anyone hearing say come and let anyone thirsting come let anyone who wishes take lifes water free
18  i am bearing witness to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll if anyone makes an addition to these things god will add to him the plagues that are written in this scroll
19  and if anyone takes anything away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy god will take his portion away from the trees of life and out of the holy city things that are written about in this scroll
20  the one who bears witness of these things says yes i am coming quickly
amen come lord jesus
21  may the undeserved kindness of the lord jesus be with the holy ones
6  and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder come
2  and i saw and look a white horse and the one seated on it had a bow and a crown was given him and he went out conquering and to complete his conquest
3  when he opened the second seal i heard the second living creature say come
4  another came out a fierycolored horse and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another and he was given a great sword
5  when he opened the third seal i heard the third living creature say come and i saw and look a black horse and the one seated on it had a pair of scales in his hand
6  i heard what sounded like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say a quart of wheat for a denarʹius and three quarts of barley for a denarʹius and do not harm the olive oil and the wine
7  when he opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature say come
8  and i saw and look a pale horse and the one seated on it had the name death
and the grave was closely following him
and authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with a long sword and with food shortage and with deadly plague and by the wild beasts of the earth
9  when he opened the fifth seal i saw underneath the altar the souls of those slaughtered because of the word of god and because of the witness they had given
10  they shouted with a loud voice saying until when sovereign lord holy and true are you refraining from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth
11  and a white robe was given to each of them and they were told to rest a little while longer until the number was filled of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed as they had been
12  and i saw when he opened the sixth seal and a great earthquake occurred and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair and the entire moon became as blood
13  and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as when a fig tree shaken by a high wind drops its unripe figs
14  and the heaven departed as a scroll that is being rolled up and every mountain and every island was removed from its place
15  then the kings of the earth the high officials the military commanders the rich the strong every slave and every free person hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains
16  and they keep saying to the mountains and to the rocks fall over us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb
17  because the great day of their wrath has come and who is able to stand
21  and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away and the sea is no more
2  i also saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
3  with that i heard a loud voice from the throne say look the tent of god is with mankind and he will reside with them and they will be his people
and god himself will be with them
4  and he will wipe out every tear from their eyes and death will be no more neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore
the former things have passed away
5  and the one seated on the throne said look i am making all things new
also he says write for these words are faithful and true
6  and he said to me they have come to pass i am the alʹpha and the omeʹga the beginning and the end
to anyone thirsting i will give from the spring of the water of life free
7  anyone conquering will inherit these things and i will be his god and he will be my son
8  but as for the cowards and those without faith and those who are disgusting in their filth and murderers and the sexually immoral and those practicing spiritism and idolaters and all the liars their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur
this means the second death
9  one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls that were full of the seven last plagues came and said to me come and i will show you the bride the lambs wife
10  so he carried me away in the power of the spirit to a great and lofty mountain and he showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god
11  and having the glory of god
its radiance was like a most precious stone like a jasper stone shining crystal clear
12  it had a great and lofty wall and had 12 gates with 12 angels at the gates and on the gates were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of israel
13  on the east were three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates
14  the wall of the city also had 12 foundation stones and on them were the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the lamb
15  now the one who was speaking with me was holding a golden reed as a measure in order to measure the city and its gates and its wall
16  and the city is laid out as a square and its length is as great as its width
and he measured the city with the reed 12000 stadia its length and width and height are equal
17  he also measured its wall 144 cubits according to a mans measure at the same time an angels measure
18  now the wall was made of jasper and the city was pure gold like clear glass
19  the foundations of the city wall were adorned with every sort of precious stone the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third chalceʹdony the fourth emerald
20  the fifth sardonʹyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysʹolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysʹoprase the eleventh hyacinth the twelfth amethyst
21  also the 12 gates were 12 pearls each one of the gates was made of one pearl
and the main street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass
22  i did not see a temple in it for jehovah god the almighty is its temple also the lamb is
23  and the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine on it for the glory of god illuminated it and its lamp was the lamb
24  and the nations will walk by means of its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it
25  its gates will not be closed at all by day for night will not exist there
26  and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it
27  but anything defiled and anyone who does what is disgusting and deceitful will in no way enter into it only those written in the lambs scroll of life will enter
13  and it stood still on the sand of the sea
and i saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads and on its horns ten diadems but on its heads blasphemous names
2  now the wild beast that i saw was like a leopard but its feet were like those of a bear and its mouth was like a lions mouth
and the dragon gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority
3  i saw that one of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded but its mortal wound had been healed and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration
4  and they worshipped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast and they worshipped the wild beast with the words who is like the wild beast and who can do battle with it
5  it was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and it was given authority to act for 42 months
6  and it opened its mouth in blasphemies against god to blaspheme his name and his dwelling place even those residing in heaven
7  it was permitted to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation
8  and all those who dwell on the earth will worship it
from the founding of the world not one of their names has been written in the scroll of life of the lamb who was slaughtered
9  if anyone has an ear let him hear
10  if anyone is meant for captivity he will go into captivity
if anyone will kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword
this is where it calls for endurance and faith on the part of the holy ones
11  then i saw another wild beast ascending out of the earth and it had two horns like a lamb but it began speaking like a dragon
12  it exercises all the authority of the first wild beast in its sight
and it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first wild beast whose mortal wound was healed
13  and it performs great signs even making fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the sight of mankind
14  it misleads those who dwell on the earth because of the signs that it was permitted to perform in the sight of the wild beast while it tells those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the wild beast that had the swordstroke and yet revived
15  and it was permitted to give breath to the image of the wild beast so that the image of the wild beast should both speak and cause to be killed all those who refuse to worship the image of the wild beast
16  it puts under compulsion all peoplethe small and the great the rich and the poor the free and the slavesthat these should be marked on their right hand or on their forehead
17  and that nobody can buy or sell except a person having the mark the name of the wild beast or the number of its name
18  this is where it calls for wisdom let the one who has insight calculate the number of the wild beast for it is a mans number and its number is 666
14  then i saw and look the lamb standing on mount zion and with him 144000 who have his name and the name of his father written on their foreheads
2  i heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder and the sound that i heard was like singers who accompany themselves by playing on their harps
3  and they are singing what seems to be a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders and no one was able to master that song except the 144000 who have been bought from the earth
4  these are the ones who did not defile themselves with women in fact they are virgins
these are the ones who keep following the lamb no matter where he goes
these were bought from among mankind as firstfruits to god and to the lamb
5  and no deceit was found in their mouths they are without blemish
6  and i saw another angel flying in midheaven and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth to every nation and tribe and tongue and people
7  he was saying in a loud voice fear god and give him glory because the hour of judgment by him has arrived so worship the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of water
8  another a second angel followed saying she has fallen babylon the great has fallen she who made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality
9  another angel a third followed them saying in a loud voice if anyone worships the wild beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand
10  he will also drink of the wine of the anger of god that is poured out undiluted into the cup of his wrath and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the lamb
11  and the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever and day and night they have no rest those who worship the wild beast and its image and whoever receives the mark of its name
12  here is where it calls for endurance on the part of the holy ones those who keep the commandments of god and hold fast to the faith of jesus
13  and i heard a voice out of heaven say write happy are the dead who die in union with the lord from this time onward
yes says the spirit let them rest from their labors for the things they did go right with them
14  then i saw and look a white cloud and seated on the cloud was someone like a son of man with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand
15  another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary calling with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud put your sickle in and reap because the hour has come to reap for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe
16  and the one seated on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth and the earth was reaped
17  and still another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary that is in heaven and he also had a sharp sickle
18  and still another angel emerged from the altar and he had authority over the fire
and he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle saying put your sharp sickle in and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for its grapes have become ripe
19  the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and he hurled it into the great winepress of gods anger
20  the winepress was trodden outside the city and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses for a distance of 1600 stadia
19  after this i heard what seemed to be a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven
they said praise jah the salvation and the glory and the power belong to our god
2  because his judgments are true and righteous
for he has executed judgment on the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality and he has avenged the blood of his slaves that is on her hands
3  and right away for the second time they said praise jah and the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever
4  and the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped god who sits on the throne and said amen praise jah
5  also a voice came from the throne and said be praising our god all you his slaves who fear him the small ones and the great
6  and i heard what sounded like a voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of heavy thunders
they said praise jah because jehovah our god the almighty has begun to rule as king
7  let us rejoice and be overjoyed and give him glory because the marriage of the lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself
8  yes it has been granted to her to be clothed with bright clean fine linenfor the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones
9  and he tells me write happy are those invited to the evening meal of the lambs marriage
also he tells me these are the true sayings of god
10  at that i fell down before his feet to worship him
but he tells me be careful do not do that i am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing concerning jesus
worship god for the witness concerning jesus is what inspires prophecy
11  i saw heaven opened and look a white horse
and the one seated on it is called faithful and true and he judges and carries on war in righteousness
12  his eyes are a fiery flame and on his head are many diadems
he has a name written that no one knows but he himself
13  and he is clothed with an outer garment stained with blood and he is called by the name the word of god
14  also the armies in heaven were following him on white horses and they were clothed in white clean fine linen
15  and out of his mouth protrudes a sharp long sword with which to strike the nations and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron
moreover he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of god the almighty
16  on his outer garment yes on his thigh he has a name written king of kings and lord of lords
17  i saw also an angel standing in the sun and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven come here be gathered together to the great evening meal of god
18  so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of strong men and the flesh of horses and of those seated on them and the flesh of all of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great
19  and i saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army
20  and the wild beast was caught and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who worship its image
while still alive they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur
21  but the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse
and all the birds were filled with their flesh
5  and i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on both sides sealed tight with seven seals
2  and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals
3  but no one in heaven or on earth or underneath the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it
4  i gave way to a great deal of weeping because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it
5  but one of the elders said to me stop weeping
look the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so as to open the scroll and its seven seals
6  and i saw standing in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a lamb that seemed to have been slaughtered having seven horns and seven eyes and the eyes mean the seven spirits of god that have been sent out into the whole earth
7  at once he came forward and took it out of the right hand of the one seated on the throne
8  when he took the scroll the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb and each one had a harp and golden bowls that were full of incense
the incense means the prayers of the holy ones
9  and they sing a new song saying you are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals for you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought people for god out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation
10  and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our god and they are to rule as kings over the earth
11  and i saw and i heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders and the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands
12  and they were saying with a loud voice the lamb who was slaughtered is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing
13  and i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth and on the sea and all the things in them saying to the one sitting on the throne and to the lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever
14  the four living creatures were saying amen and the elders fell down and worshipped
15  and i saw in heaven another sign great and wonderful seven angels with seven plagues
these are the last ones because by means of them the anger of god is brought to a finish
2  and i saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire and those who are victorious over the wild beast and its image and the number of its name were standing by the sea of glass holding harps of god
3  they were singing the song of moses the slave of god and the song of the lamb saying great and wonderful are your works jehovah god the almighty
righteous and true are your ways king of eternity
4  who will not really fear you jehovah and glorify your name for you alone are loyal for all the nations will come and worship before you because your righteous decrees have been revealed
5  after this i saw and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness was opened in heaven
6  and the seven angels with the seven plagues emerged from the sanctuary clothed with clean bright linen and with golden sashes wrapped around their chests
7  one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of god who lives forever and ever
8  and the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of god and because of his power and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished
20  and i saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand
2  he seized the dragon the original serpent who is the devil and satan and bound him for 1000 years
3  and he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him so that he would not mislead the nations anymore until the 1000 years were ended
after this he must be released for a little while
4  and i saw thrones and those who sat on them were given authority to judge
yes i saw the souls of those executed for the witness they gave about jesus and for speaking about god and those who had not worshipped the wild beast or its image and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand
and they came to life and ruled as kings with the christ for 1000 years
5  the rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1000 years were ended
this is the first resurrection
6  happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection over these the second death has no authority but they will be priests of god and of the christ and they will rule as kings with him for the 1000 years
7  now as soon as the 1000 years have ended satan will be released from his prison
8  and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth gog and maʹgog to gather them together for the war
the number of these is as the sand of the sea
9  and they advanced over the whole earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city
but fire came down out of heaven and consumed them
10  and the devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur where both the wild beast and the false prophet already were and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever
11  and i saw a great white throne and the one seated on it
from before him the earth and the heaven fled away and no place was found for them
12  and i saw the dead the great and the small standing before the throne and scrolls were opened
but another scroll was opened it is the scroll of life
the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds
13  and the sea gave up the dead in it and death and the grave gave up the dead in them and they were judged individually according to their deeds
14  and death and the grave were hurled into the lake of fire
this means the second death the lake of fire
15  furthermore whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire
1  a revelation by jesus christ which god gave him to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place
and he sent his angel and presented it in signs through him to his slave john
2  who bore witness to the word god gave and to the witness jesus christ gave yes to all the things he saw
3  happy is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy and who observe the things written in it for the appointed time is near
4  john to the seven congregations that are in the province of asia may you have undeserved kindness and peace from the one who is and who was and who is coming and from the seven spirits that are before his throne
5  and from jesus christ the faithful witness the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth
to him who loves us and who set us free from our sins by means of his own blood
6  and he made us to be a kingdom priests to his god and fatheryes to him be the glory and the might forever
amen
7  look he is coming with the clouds and every eye will see him and those who pierced him and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him
yes amen
8  i am the alʹpha and the omeʹga says jehovah god the one who is and who was and who is coming the almighty
9  i john your brother and a sharer with you in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in association with jesus was on the island called patʹmos for speaking about god and bearing witness concerning jesus
10  by inspiration i came to be in the lords day and i heard behind me a strong voice like that of a trumpet
11  saying what you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven congregations in ephʹesus in smyrʹna in perʹgamum in thyatiʹra in sarʹdis in philadelphia and in laodiceʹa
12  i turned to see who was speaking with me and when i turned i saw seven golden lampstands
13  and in the midst of the lampstands someone like a son of man clothed in a garment that reached down to the feet and wearing a golden sash around his chest
14  moreover his head and his hair were white as white wool as snow and his eyes were like a fiery flame
15  and his feet were like fine copper when glowing in a furnace and his voice was like the sound of many waters
16  and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth a sharp long twoedged sword was protruding and his countenance was like the sun when it shines at its brightest
17  when i saw him i fell as dead at his feet
and he laid his right hand on me and said do not be afraid
i am the first and the last
18  and the living one and i became dead but look i am living forever and ever and i have the keys of death and of the grave
19  so write down the things you saw and the things that are and the things that will take place after these
20  as for the sacred secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands the seven stars mean the angels of the seven congregations and the seven lampstands mean the seven congregations
2  to the angel of the congregation in ephʹesus write these are the things that he says who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands
2  i know your deeds and your labor and endurance and that you cannot tolerate bad men and that you put to the test those who say they are apostles but they are not and you found them to be liars
3  you are also showing endurance and you have persevered for the sake of my name and have not grown weary
4  nevertheless i hold this against you that you have left the love you had at first
5  therefore remember from where you have fallen and repent and do the deeds you did at first
if you do not i will come to you and i will remove your lampstand from its place unless you repent
6  still you do have this in your favor that you hate the deeds of the sect of nicolaʹus which i also hate
7  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations to the one who conquers i will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of god
8  and to the angel of the congregation in smyrʹna write these are the things that he says the first and the last who became dead and came to life again
9  i know your tribulation and povertybut you are richand the blasphemy by those who call themselves jews and really are not but they are a synagogue of satan
10  do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer
look the devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison so that you may be fully put to the test and you will have tribulation for ten days
prove yourself faithful even to death and i will give you the crown of life
11  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations the one who conquers will by no means be harmed by the second death
12  to the angel of the congregation in perʹgamum write these are the things that he says who has the sharp long twoedged sword
13  i know where you are dwelling that is where the throne of satan is and yet you keep holding fast to my name and you did not deny your faith in me even in the days of anʹtipas my faithful witness who was killed by your side where satan is dwelling
14  nevertheless i have a few things against you that you have there those adhering to the teaching of baʹlaam who taught baʹlak to put a stumbling block before the sons of israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality
15  in the same way you also have those adhering to the teaching of the sect of nicolaʹus
16  so repent
if you do not i am coming to you quickly and i will war against them with the long sword of my mouth
17  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations to the one who conquers i will give some of the hidden manna and i will give him a white pebble and written on the pebble is a new name that no one knows except the one receiving it
18  to the angel of the congregation in thyatiʹra write these are the things that the son of god says the one who has eyes like a fiery flame and whose feet are like fine copper
19  i know your deeds and your love and faith and ministry and endurance and that your deeds of late are more than those you did at first
20  nevertheless i do hold this against you that you tolerate that woman jezʹebel who calls herself a prophetess and she teaches and misleads my slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat things sacrificed to idols
21  and i gave her time to repent but she is not willing to repent of her sexual immorality
22  look i am about to throw her into a sickbed and those committing adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of her deeds
23  and i will kill her children with deadly plague so that all the congregations will know that i am the one who searches the innermost thoughts and hearts and i will give to you individually according to your deeds
24  however i say to the rest of you who are in thyatiʹra all those who do not follow this teaching those who did not get to know the socalled deep things of satan i am not putting on you any other burden
25  just the same hold fast to what you have until i come
26  and to the one who conquers and observes my deeds down to the end i will give authority over the nations
27  and he will shepherd the people with an iron rod so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels just as i have received from my father
28  and i will give him the morning star
29  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations
3  to the angel of the congregation in sarʹdis write these are the things that he says who has the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know your deeds that you have the name that you are alive but you are dead
2  become watchful and strengthen the things remaining that were ready to die for i have not found your works fully performed before my god
3  therefore continue mindful of how you have received and how you heard and go on keeping it and repent
certainly unless you wake up i will come as a thief and you will not know at all at what hour i will come upon you
4  nevertheless you do have a few individuals in sarʹdis who did not defile their garments and they will walk with me in white ones because they are worthy
5  the one who conquers will thus be dressed in white garments and i will by no means blot out his name from the book of life but i will acknowledge his name before my father and before his angels
6  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations
7  to the angel of the congregation in philadelphia write these are the things he says who is holy who is true who has the key of david who opens so that no one will shut and shuts so that no one opens
8  i know your deedslook i have set before you an opened door which no one can shut
and i know that you have a little power and you kept my word and did not prove false to my name
9  look i will make those from the synagogue of satan who say they are jews yet are not but are lyinglook i will make them come and bow before your feet and make them know that i have loved you
10  because you kept the word about my endurance i will also keep you from the hour of test which is to come upon the entire inhabited earth to put to the test those dwelling on the earth
11  i am coming quickly
keep holding fast to what you have so that no one may take your crown
12  the one who conquersi will make him a pillar in the temple of my god and he will by no means go out from it anymore and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem that descends out of heaven from my god and my own new name
13  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations
14  to the angel of the congregation in laodiceʹa write these are the things that the amen says the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation by god
15  i know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot
i wish you were cold or else hot
16  so because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold i am going to vomit you out of my mouth
17  because you say i am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all but you do not know that you are miserable and pitiful and poor and blind and naked
18  i advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich and white garments so that you may become dressed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be exposed and eyesalve to rub in your eyes so that you may see
19  all those for whom i have affection i reprove and discipline
so be zealous and repent
20  look i am standing at the door and knocking
if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come into his house and take the evening meal with him and he with me
21  to the one who conquers i will grant to sit down with me on my throne just as i conquered and sat down with my father on his throne
22  let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations
12  then a great sign was seen in heaven a woman was arrayed with the sun and the moon was beneath her feet and on her head was a crown of 12 stars
2  and she was pregnant
and she was crying out in her pains and in her agony to give birth
3  another sign was seen in heaven
look a great fierycolored dragon with seven heads and ten horns and on its heads seven diadems
4  and its tail drags a third of the stars of heaven and it hurled them down to the earth
and the dragon kept standing before the woman who was about to give birth so that when she did give birth it might devour her child
5  and she gave birth to a son a male who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod
and her child was snatched away to god and to his throne
6  and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared by god and where they would feed her for 1260 days
7  and war broke out in heaven miʹchael and his angels battled with the dragon and the dragon and its angels battled
8  but they did not prevail nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven
9  so down the great dragon was hurled the original serpent the one called devil and satan who is misleading the entire inhabited earth he was hurled down to the earth and his angels were hurled down with him
10  i heard a loud voice in heaven say now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down who accuses them day and night before our god
11  and they conquered him because of the blood of the lamb and because of the word of their witnessing and they did not love their souls even in the face of death
12  on this account be glad you heavens and you who reside in them woe for the earth and for the sea because the devil has come down to you having great anger knowing that he has a short period of time
13  now when the dragon saw that it had been hurled down to the earth it persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child
14  but the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place where she is to be fed for a time and times and half a time away from the face of the serpent
15  and the serpent spewed out water like a river from its mouth after the woman to cause her to be drowned by the river
16  but the earth came to the womans help and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon spewed out from its mouth
17  so the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her offspring who observe the commandments of god and have the work of bearing witness concerning jesus
